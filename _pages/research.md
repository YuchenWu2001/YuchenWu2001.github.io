My research focuses on solving <strong>path and motion planning</strong> problems for single and multiple robots, especially on the topic of sensor-based motion planning. In particular, my research aims to find the connection between raw sensory information and predefined objectives while efficiently computing feasible motion plans to optimize current robot actions. These problems often arise in smart manufacturing. In the future, I would like to investigate more path and motion planning problems, including <strong>safe and efficient motion planning</strong> and <strong>multi-robot collaboration</strong>.

## In-situ Inspection and Repair using Dual-Arm System
- Proposed motion planning algorithms to achieve in-situ repair of industrial parts by applying **coverage scanning** and **non-planar 3D printing**. [[View more](/research/insitu_repair)]

## Autonomous Calibration Toolbox based on UR5e
- Designed a calibration toolbox that supports **multiple** types of calibration and **automatically** collects photo samples without the need of human intervention. [[View more](/research/insitu_repair)]

## 2D Heterogeneous Coverage
- Implemented a motion planner for a team of 4 heterogenenous agents with different color to paint a 2D canvas collectively. [[View more](/research/insitu_repair)]

## Dynamic Path Planning
- Proposed a dyanmic obstacle avoidance offset to robot's local controller to acheive fast collision avoidance for factory mobile bases. [[View more](/research/insitu_repair)]
